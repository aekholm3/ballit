Welcome to BALLIT!

Get Started:
This prototype was developed for the iPhone XS using React Native and Expo. The .zip file of the GitHub repository can be downloaded from our website. To run the app using Expo:
Install the Expo app onto your phone from the App Store.
Download the .zip file of the BALLIT repository from our website. 
Unzip the file. 
Open your terminal. 
Type npm install exp --global. 
Locate the directory where the file is, then cd into the directory /ballit.
Type npm install. 
Type expo start and scan the QR code printed in the terminal with your phone camera (make sure that your phone is unlocked and that your phone camera is a sufficient distance from your computer screen to pick up the QR code), then click on the banner that pops up to open the app in Expo. 
The app should now be opened in Expo and display the launch screen with the “Get Started” button.

Limitations:
In this app, we have hardcoded a lot of the data. Therefore, you are taking on the persona Abbee Brown, a young Gen Z-er from Stanford, California. She leans more to the left, and has partitioned the following policies in this manner:
Environment → I agree!
Gun Ownership → I disagree.
Healthcare → I don’t care.
Taxes → I agree!
Immigration → I agree!.
Campaign → I don’t care.
Abortion → I agree!
Marijuana → I disagree.
Refugees → I agree!
College → I don’t care.

Based on these preferences, the rest of the tasks are hard coded. Due to time restrictions, we do not have the functionality to change policy preferences, but we would envision the ability to re-swipe on policies.t
